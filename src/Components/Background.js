                    A Mathematics Graduate from the University of Birmingham and
                    recent Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp Graduate from
                    futureproof.

                    <br />
                    I gained experience with C++ and MATLAB at University and it
                    was after graduating that I started exploring other
                    languages through the form of online courses and quickly
                    realised that the more I learned, the more I loved it! This
                    led me to apply to futureproof's coding bootcamp.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The futureproof bootcamp gave me experience with
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            working individually on time restricted debugging
                            assignments
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            pair programming while using GitHub and version
                            control best practices
                        </li>
                        <li>collaborating in groups on week-long projects</li>
                        <li>daily stand-ups and weekly retros</li>
