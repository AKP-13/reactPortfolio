                    Hey! My name is Alex and I am a Mathematics Graduate from
                    the University of Birmingham. I got into coding last year
                    when I returned home from 3 months of travelling through
                    Southeast Asia and, unwilling to let the last 3 moths go, I
                    thought it’d be really cool to learn how to build a blog and
                    a photography portfolio from scratch to showcase my travels.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This lead me to complete online courses and begin learning
                    about basic web development in the form of HTML , CSS and
                    JavaScript. I quickly realised that the more I learned, the
                    more I loved it! I became amazed by the endless
                    possibilities these skills, languages and technologies
                    provided and where they could take me if I pursued a career
                    in coding.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This lead me to apply for futureproof’s 13 week Web
                    Developer Bootcamp and here I am now at the other end of the
                    course having gained experience with working with a vast
                    range of amazing technologies, collaborating in teams to
                    create secure full-stack applications and, more importantly
                    (in my opinion), feeling like I have the confidence to
                    tackle any problem presented to me going forward — no matter
                    the language!
