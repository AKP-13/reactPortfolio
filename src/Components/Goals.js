                    I am incredibly excited to build on the foundations I gained
                    from futureproof and apply myself in a company whose goals
                    and visions align with my own.

                    I am constantly learning more skills while working on new
                    projects and would love to work for a company that would
                    allow me to incorporate my technical skills with my other
                    passions and ultimately contribute to making the world a
                    better place and improving peopleâ€™s lives.
