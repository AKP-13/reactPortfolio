                    Armed with the confidence to tackle new problems and
                    countless new skills, I am incredibly excited to build on
                    the foundations I gained from futureproof and always
                    continue learning. In this ever changing industry, I am
                    eager to continue broadening my skills and put them to use
                    in my own personal projects. Going forward, I would love to
                    incorporate my love of technology with my other passions —
                    whether it’s sustainability, renewable energy, food, fitness
                    or health — and ultimately contribute to making the world a
                    better place and improving people’s lives.
